# Aerospace Projects

In this repository I will try to collect all the undertaken projects during my degree at Universidad de Sevilla.
The following projects are included in this repository:

- [Analysis of Boundary Layer Transition for NACA Airfoils](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/AerospaceProjects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Boundary%20Layer%20transition%20on%20NACA%20profiles)

- [Design and Development of a Military Transport Aircraft](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/AerospaceProjects/tree/main/Design%20Process%20of%20a%20Military%20Transport%20Aircraft)

- [Dimensioning the Torsion Box of a Wing](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/AerospaceProjects/tree/main/Dimensioning%20of%20the%20torsion%20box%20of%20a%20wing)

- [Design and Animation of a Metalworking Shaper using CAD software](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/AerospaceProjects/tree/main/Metalworking%20Shaper%20CAD%20design%20and%20animation)

- [Structural Design of a Moon Lander](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/AerospaceProjects/tree/main/Moon%20Lander%20structural%20design)


## Software

The following software programs were used in these projects:

- MATLAB: high-level programming language and numerical computing environment that is widely used in engineering, science, and mathematics.

- CATIA: comprehensive computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)/computer-aided engineering (CAE) software suite that is widely used in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial equipment industries.

- PATRAN: pre- and post-processing software tool for finite element analysis (FEA) that is commonly used in the aerospace, automotive, and defense industries.

- KEYSHOT: computer graphics software used for rendering 3D models and animations with photo-realistic quality.

- LATEX: document preparation system that is widely used for typesetting technical and scientific documents, such as research papers, theses, and textbooks.
