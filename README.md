# Aerospace Projects

In this repository I will try to collect all the projects that I did during my degree in Universidad de Sevilla.
The softwares used are the following:

- MATLAB: high-level programming language and numerical computing environment that is widely used in engineering, science, and mathematics.

- CATIA: comprehensive computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)/computer-aided engineering (CAE) software suite that is widely used in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial equipment industries.

- PATRAN: pre- and post-processing software tool for finite element analysis (FEA) that is commonly used in the aerospace, automotive, and defense industries.

- KEYSHOT: computer graphics software used for rendering 3D models and animations with photo-realistic quality.

- LATEX: document preparation system that is widely used for typesetting technical and scientific documents, such as research papers, theses, and textbooks.
